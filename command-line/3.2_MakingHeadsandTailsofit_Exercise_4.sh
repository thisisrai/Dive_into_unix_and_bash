# Question: One of the most useful applications of tail is running tail -f to view a file that’s actively changing. This is especially common when monitoring files used to log the activity of, e.g., web servers, a practice known as “tailing the log file”. To simulate the creation of a log file, run ping learnenough.com > learnenough.log in one terminal tab. (The ping command “pings” a server to see if it’s working.) In a second tab, type the command to tail the log file. (At this point, both tabs will be stuck, so once you’ve gotten the gist of tail -f you should use the technique from Box 4 to get out of trouble.)

ping learnenough.com > learnenough.log
tail -f learnenough.log

# cool things start happening.
